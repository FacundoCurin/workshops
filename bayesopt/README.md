# Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning in Machine Learning

Authors: Jakob Richter

### Description

In this workshop you will learn how to use Bayesian Optimization (also known as Model-based Optimization) to tune the performance of your machine learning model.
We will cover basic aspects of hyperparameter tuning such as nested resampling as well as the theoretical foundations of bayesian optimization.
The examples in this workshop will use `mlr3` and `mlr3mbo`.

## Requirements

* basic knowledge of R and machine learning
* installed RStudio and packages mlr3, mlr3tuning, mlr3learners
