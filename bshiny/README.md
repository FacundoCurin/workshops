# Basics of Shiny

Authors: Weronika Pucha≈Ça, Katarzyna Sidorczuk, Krystyna Grzesiak

## About the workshop

The presentation and visualization of the results is the critical aspect of data science. No matter how advanced the analysis is if one cannot see what data tells. An effective way of presenting the data analysis is a reactive shiny application, where one can manipulate the parameters and see how they affect the result. If you do not know how to do that but would like to learn - this is a workshop for you!

In this workshop, you will learn how to build simple applications using shiny package. We will start by composing a static application and gradually add some aspects of reactivity, both on tabular and graphical data. By the end, you will get the basic knowledge of shiny package and be ready to explore on your own.
