# Good Practice for {shiny} in production with {golem}

## Abstract

Organizing large `{shiny}` applications is a complex task, and can quickly become a daunting enterprise if the whole project wasn't built on solid grounds.
But what if we could create robust `{shiny}` applications from the very begining? 
Search no more, that is what the `{golem}` package has been designed for: building robust, production-grade applications from the very beginning.

During this workshop, Colin will gives an overview of the best practices for creating `{shiny}` applications using `{golem}`: how to organize your project, and how to use the various tools made available by `{golem}` to be sure your application will be successful on the long run. 

## Intended audience 

`{shiny}` developers with few to no experience of `{golem}` and with package development basic knowledge.
